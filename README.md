# poorjit

A poor man's jit for C++ for when you want to instantiate and call templates at
runtime. Is there a more efficient way to do this? sure, but this is ~100 lines
of code I wrote in less than an afternoon. Almost certainly only works on Linux
and with either clang or g++.

See `test` for a usage example.
